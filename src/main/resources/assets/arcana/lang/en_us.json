    "aspects": "Aspects of Magic",
    "aspects.desc": "The Building Blocks",
    "aspects.text": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them are key insights into the workings of reality.\nAll matter is composed of Aspects, the fundamental building blocks of reality. Aspects come in a number of varieties, about {c3}{$numOfAspects}{r}, each of which corresponds to some concept.\nAll aspects are composed of two simpler aspects, with the exception of the six Primal aspects: {aspect:air}{c6}aer{r} (air), {aspect:earth}{c2}terra{r} (earth), {aspect:water}{c1}aqua{r} (water), {aspect:fire}{c4}ignis{r} (fire), {aspect:order}{c7}ordo{r} (order), and {aspect:entropy}perditio (entropy).\nThe chemical elements are, unintuitively, also fundamental building blocks. Elements and aspects are two \"lenses\" with which to view and modify the world, and different things lend themselves to a different lens.\nThese aspects can also apparently be isolated into solid-like, fluid-like, and gaseous forms. Crystals are solid, and result from overflows of a particular aspect in the aura. The aura, in turn, is made up of the more gaseous vis form, and is almost entirely uniform, except around nodes, which produce a constant supply of primal vis.\nFinally, equipment can supposedly be used to purify it into a fluid state known as essentia. The notes were frustratingly vague on this... the equipment seems both too complex to infer from diagrams, yet so commmonplace that they neglected to explain properly. Their most powerful tools relied on it extensively, seemingly forcing me to reinvent their basic practices myself.",

    "flux.stage.1": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them were various vague warnings of \"flux\", \"taint\", and \"warp\", as consequences for mishandling magic.\nFlux is a kind of pollution of the aura, produced through wasteful alchemy, or inefficient equipment. While nothing arcane is without risks, a buildup of flux can pose serious risks to yourself and the world.\nTaint being one of them. Some sort of corruption, or parasite, or {i}something{i}, that works its way through the world, and twists living beings into horrific monsters when left to its own devices; feeding on the flux created by ambitious or negligent alchemists.\nAnd while I couldn't fully parse the notes on warp... the dark rituals and grim compulsions that surrounded it were certainly enough to provide a bad first impression.\nIf I don't study these risks, how am I supposed to protect myself from them? I should get a look of this \"flux\" myself. A small amount should be perfectly manageable.",
    "flux.stage.2": "...that was probably a mistake. Everything just {i}feels{i} off here. I would do well not to let it grow much higher, lest it start producing physical effects more serious than a headache and stomachache... ugh, I don't even want to know what warp feels like.",

Their wood is one of the few things capable of resisting {i}purified essentia{r}; every part of the plant is completely immune to, and even repels, taint; and occasionally, their growth can even create a new Pure Node.\nIt should go without saying that growing and studying these trees wherever possible is a high priority.",

A single tree should provide enough wood for anything I could need, and enough saplings to make that certain.\nTheir magical nature will make them quite useful in future work.",

At the same time, they provide a prime opportunity: to feed them with matter, and create a powerful vis battery to take advantage of.\n...they pose a difficult question too. How {i}do{r} other nodes create vis? Where does it come from? One cannot create energy, only convert it from matter; could other nodes simply be openings to hungry nodes elsewhere?",

These nodes... hate you, somehow, and they make their feelings known.\nI believe they have some impact on what the notes referred to as {c3}warp{r}, too, worsening it within their presence.\nCareful observation shows their true shape: a pulsating eye. What they are looking for, I cannot know.",

Such {i}Nodal Geodes{r} are a valuable source of otherwise-sparse crystals.\nUnlike surface nodes, each geode is attuned to only one kind of primal vis, which permeates through the rock that makes it up, alongside condensing into crystals. The node within will be especially potent in that aspect.\nGiven a method of viewing nodes, finding nodal geodes should not be too difficult, but reaching them might be a chore.",

These aspects do not act like the ordinary primals.\nEvery one of my various theories falls apart every moment this changes form. I would suggest it might be consciously obfuscating itself, but doing so leaves it perfectly simple and easy to understand - for one, fleeting moment, until all clarity is lost once more.\nIt stays constant only in one aspect: the aspects it contains. It... must have existed before compound aspects themselves, if there was such a time? Or perhaps it exists in some other way, one that cannot be expressed as aspects entirely?",

This focus can be cast with any basic wand, and the length of time creatures stay on fire for depends on the wand's difficulty.\nCasting using a focus takes some vis from the wand. This amount is affected by discounts in the same way as arcane crafting; the original amount is displayed in the focus tooltip, while the discounted amount is displayed in the wand's (when equipped).",

    "light_focus.desc": "Let there be light",
    "light_focus.stage.1": "One of the most tedious things of my journey, by far, has been carrying around enough torches and light sources for everywhere I go; wasting my inventory space and ending exploration or mining sessions prematurely.\nIdeally, I could simply point at a spot with my wand, mention a spell, and have a light source spring forth. Like a real magician.",
    "light_focus.stage.2": "This focus creates light sources using stored aer and ignis, fused to make lux.\nThese light sources are temporary, losing brightness over time until they fade away entirely, making them sadly unsuitable for anything permanent. Perhaps some invisible nitor could suit that role? But they don't require any space or special considerations on-the-go, so I consider this a success.\nInitially, a light source is as bright as glowstone - brighter than a torch - and dims until it is unable to repel monsters, before vanishing, and can also be broken by hand. They can be placed underwater without issue.",

    "portable_hole_focus.stage.1": "The ender pearl and chorus fruit have a curious ability to warp space.\nThese naturally occurring materials do it in a raw, unfocused form; with some careful manipulation, and the added power of the wand's vis, something much safer and more powerful should be possible.",
    "portable_hole_focus.stage.2": "I don't really understand how this works.\nI went into this expecting to create a teleportation focus, but rather than moving me through space, this focus changes the space around me. When I use it against a surface, the focus temporarily phases it out, along with everything behind it, allowing me to pass through walls and into caves.\nThe focus creates 3x3 tunnels that can reach up to 16 blocks in length, but end when they reach a full square of air. They can be oriented in any direction, including vertically.\nAny block can be phased out, including containers, and blocks that support other blocks. Such systems remain fully stable; for all intents and purposes, those blocks still exist, except for entities to look and pass through. Space is warped, but matter is untouched.\nI would do well to research the structure of space in more detail. Some other time.",

    "magical_metallurgy.stage.1": "Mundane materials just aren't cutting it anymore.\nTools break too quickly, armour doesn't protect well enough, and these materials simply aren't as conductive to the arcane crafts as I would like. Even enchantment is a nuisance.\nThe notes often reference a material named {u}Thaumium{r}, created by alchemically imbuing a metal with magic itself. I don't know what their metallurgy was like - it seems that the set of ores available to me differ to what they had - but the principle seems sound.",
    "magical_metallurgy.stage.2": "This isn't thaumium. At least, not like they described. It's similar in strength and conductivity, but blindingly bright, and seems to be giving off it's infused magic over time... maybe I overshot somewhat.\nEither way, it's stronger than most materials I have in plentiful supply, and more conductive to vis than any.\nEntire blocks can be transmuted, at a slight discount. All the usual tool and armour recipes work.",

    "transmutation.stage.2": "Converting iron into copper is not my most impressive achievement - though the alchemy behind this recipe {wavy}does{r} prompt more research into it's properties. No, gold is my target. Though copper may make a useful stepping stone...",
    "transmutation.stage.3": "Yes! Where thousands of fictional alchemists have failed, I have succeeded in transforming iron into gold.\nI do wonder if the process is reversible, though... or could be performed in bulk.",
    "transmutation.stage.4": "The transmutations form a loop: iron into copper, copper into gold, and gold into iron. Could be useful given a particular shortage of iron.. perhaps if I was into mundane science.\nWhat's also interesting is that each of these recipes can be applied in block form, at a slight discount.",

    "purification": "Purification",
    "purification.stage.1": "Simply baking ores and letting the metal melt out is an immensely inefficient process. Crushing the ores might be less so, but would still leave me waiting twice as long to process them. I have a better idea.\nWith alchemy, it should be possibly to wash away the stone and all other impurities, and leave behind a pure structure of metal to be melted into ingots all at once.\n...I just need to figure out how.",
    "purification.stage.2": "This is certainly one way of doing it.\nThe aspects added reinforce the metal's structure, with the extra metallum acting as a substitute for the impurities. This does mean that some metal is required as input, and some of the input is still wasted, but I could not find a better way around it.\nNow, to apply this to other metals. With luck, there should be no nasty surprises awaiting me.",
    "purification.stage.3": "Copper and gold can be purified and cast in exactly the same manner as iron; their disparate properties seem to have had no effect on the process.\nAdditionally, the process can be applied in bulk to raw metal blocks, at a slight discount.",

    "alumentum.stage.2": "And Alumentum is the solution. Like nitor, it is a never-ending flame, but this one can only barely keep itself together.\nAs a fuel, it should last about {c3}4x{r} as good as coal.\nIf I throw it, it will violently explode upon hitting a surface. I should take great care handling this... or not, depending on where I find myself.",

    "hedge_alchemy.stage.2": "From my observation, {i}Gunpowder{r} is closely alchemically related to {i}Blaze Powder{r}; {i}Redstone{r} and {i}Glowstone{r} have similar structures; and {i}Quartz{r} has an odd (but promising) resemblance to {i}Diamond{r}. The Lava was a dud.\nI believe I can alchemy to emulate more mundane reactions: tanning {i}Rotten Flesh{r} into {i}Leather{r}, freezing {i}Snow{r} into {i}Ice{r}, drying {i}Leaves{r} into {i}Dead Bushes{r}, and binding {i}String{r} into {i}Cobwebs{r}.\nSome experimental verification is needed.",
    "hedge_alchemy.stage.3": "Most of these conversions are viable alchemy recipes. Quartz-to-diamond was a dud too, simply turning into flint in any practical setting, and converting snow into ice proved far less efficient than expected.\nCould this be due to my equipment, or my technique? Perhaps, but in any case, the remainder remain useful.",

But really, what's stopping me from simply... teaching a dropper how to do it?",
    "automated_alchemy.stage.2": "Prototype after prototype wasted. Something odd is afoot here. Even getting a machine to perform identical actions to myself does not cause the proper reactions. Almost like some {i}intent{r} is necessary.",

    "automated_alchemy.stage.4": "Giving a Dropper a basic level of \"understanding\" is a perfectly safe and simple method of automating alchemy.\nThe Knowledgeable Dropper can be given a Tome of Sharing within it's extra tenth slot. Items it drops will be eligible for any alchemy recipes stored within the research bound to the book. When an alchemy recipe is performed automatically, the result will be thrown from the crucible in a random, free horizontal direction (or just randomly if none are free).\nAnother minor feature is that these droppers have slightly less variation in how they drop items.\nIt turns out that Tomes of Sharing do remember research entries, but simply choose not to show them to players. The thought of my equipment colluding to snoop on my mind is unsettling... but what can a book really do?",

    "alchemical_glass.stage.2": "The first fruits of my work come in the form of Hardened Glass. Stronger - resisting explosions and less prone to accidents - yet more resilient - dropping itself in one piece when broken.\nI do have questions about what other properties I can give to glass this way... how about making it even more conductive to light and vis?",
    "alchemical_glass.stage.3": "As-is, glass isn't much more opaque than empty space. No, the interesting part is when you allow it to capture light and vis.\nLuminiferous Glass, while appearing transparent, has a huge amount of photons and lux captured within. On the outside, this manifests as a bright glow, on par with Glowstone. In the future, a material like this will be useful to use as a component in magical devices.\nNow, I wonder if it's possible to make glass conductive to not just energy, but matter. Would it simply fall through the crucible? Is it even a well-formed question?",
    "alchemical_glass.stage.4": "...apparently, yes, this is fully possible.\nStatic Glass is usually solid, but becomes like a gas in the presence of a crouching player - allowing their passage (or fall) - before reforming into a solid.\nThis has a couple of potential applications in home decor.
