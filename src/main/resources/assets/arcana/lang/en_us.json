  "research.arcana.aspects.text": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them are key insights into the workings of reality.\nAll matter is composed of Aspects, the fundamental building blocks of reality. Aspects come in a number of varieties, about {c3}{$numOfAspects}{r}, each of which corresponds to some concept.\nAll aspects are composed of two simpler aspects, with the exception of the six Primal aspects: {aspect:air}{c6}aer{r} (air), {aspect:earth}{c2}terra{r} (earth), {aspect:water}{c1}aqua{r} (water), {aspect:fire}{c4}ignis{r} (fire), {aspect:order}{c7}ordo{r} (order), and {aspect:entropy}perditio (entropy).\nThe chemical elements are, unintuitively, also fundamental building blocks. Elements and aspects are two \"lenses\" with which to view and modify the world, and different things lend themselves to a different lens.\nThese aspects can also apparently be isolated into solid-like, fluid-like, and gaseous forms. Crystals are solid, and result from overflows of a particular aspect in the aura. The aura, in turn, is made up of the more gaseous vis form, and is almost entirely uniform, except around nodes, which produce a constant supply of primal vis.\nFinally, equipment can supposedly be used to purify it into a fluid state known as essentia. The notes were frustratingly vague on this... the equipment seems both too complex to infer from diagrams, yet so commmonplace that they neglected to explain properly. Their most powerful tools relied on it extensively, seemingly forcing me to reinvent their basic practices myself.",

  "research.arcana.flux.stage.1": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them were various vague warnings of \"flux\", \"taint\", and \"warp\", as consequences for mishandling magic.\nFlux is a kind of pollution of the aura, produced through wasteful alchemy, or inefficient equipment. While nothing arcane is without risks, a buildup of flux can pose serious risks to yourself and the world.\nTaint being one of them. Some sort of corruption, or parasite, or {i}something{i}, that works its way through the world, and twists living beings into horrific monsters when left to its own devices; feeding on the flux created by ambitious or negligent alchemists.\nAnd while I couldn't fully parse the notes on warp... the dark rituals and grim compulsions that surrounded it were certainly enough to provide a bad first impression.\nIf I don't study these risks, how am I supposed to protect myself from them? I should get a look of this \"flux\" myself. A small amount should be perfectly manageable.",
  "research.arcana.flux.stage.2": "...that was probably a mistake. Everything just {i}feels{i} off here. I would do well not to let it grow much higher, lest it start producing physical effects more serious than a headache and stomachache... ugh, I don't even want to know what warp feels like.",

Their wood is one of the few things capable of resisting {i}purified essentia{r}; every part of the plant is completely immune to, and even repels, taint; and occasionally, their growth can even create a new Pure Node.\nIt should go without saying that growing and studying these trees wherever possible is a high priority.",

A single tree should provide enough wood for anything I could need, and enough saplings to make that certain.\nTheir magical nature will make them quite useful in future work.",

At the same time, they provide a prime opportunity: to feed them with matter, and create a powerful vis battery to take advantage of.\n...they pose a difficult question too. How {i}do{r} other nodes create vis? Where does it come from? One cannot create energy, only convert it from matter; could other nodes simply be openings to hungry nodes elsewhere?",

These nodes... hate you, somehow, and they make their feelings known.\nI believe they have some impact on what the notes referred to as {c3}warp{r}, too, worsening it within their presence.\nCareful observation shows their true shape: a pulsating eye.

  "research.arcana.wandcraft.stage.2": "Now, I have a real way to control magic. Soon, I'll be tapping on walls and whispering spells to open hidden gateways...\nBut first, I'll need to charge my wand with energy, by draining a node of it's power.",

Something I believed to be impossible.{~sep}Nodes aren't quite uniform. Different nodes are attuned to different aspects, only producing those, and holding onto larger amounts of them.\nSome nodes are brighter than others, producing vis more rapidly and holding onto more.\nI can drain their vis into a wand by holding right-click. As long as I don't completely drain them, their aspects will simply replenish over time.\nFully emptying one can damage it, lowering it's aspect caps - or worse, paling it - so I should be careful.{~sep}A few of them seem to act... strangely.

  "research.arcana.arcane_crafting.stage.2": "An Arcane Crafting Table is capable of everything it's ordinary variant is capable of, but can additionally craft magical items that require vis, supplied by my wand.\nOne such critical item is the Goggles of Revealing, which makes visible the vis around me.\nWhen the goggles are worn, nodes become brighter and visible through terrain, and I can see the aspects contained within them.\nOf course, further investigation into arcane devices is in order. I'll store this in the {c3}Artifice{r} tab of the Arcanum, accessible by selecting the goggles icon on the left.",

  "research.arcana.research.stage.2": "Now I have a proper space to do my work.\nMany insights and items will require me to sit down at a research table and complete a {i}research puzzle{i}. The exact puzzle will depend on what I'm trying to learn about. By clicking on the puzzle requirement with paper and Scribing Tools on me, I can get a Research Note to place inside the table and start working on.{~sep}The basic puzzle, {i}Chemistry{i}, requires me to connect a set of aspects on a hexagonal grid.\nEach note starts with a somewhat-random amount of each primal aspect. I can combine two aspects (if there exists a compound of them) by placing them at the bottom of the sidebar, and pressing '+'. I can also place aspects on the grid by left clicking; both use up the amount on that note. Compound aspects connect to their components (and vice versa, components to their compounds).\nOnce all pre-placed aspects are connected, the puzzle is solved. If I make a mistake, I can right click on the grid to remove an aspect; it is not returned to the note, though, so if I'm too wasteful, I may need to restart with a new note.\nI should give this a go now.",
  "research.arcana.research.stage.3": "This puzzle isn't too hard, though I can picture more complex items requiring more effort, with more complex aspects.\nI should keep in mind that the {c3}Aspects of Magic{r} page displays all aspect combinations, in case I get stuck.",

But really, what's stopping me from simply... teaching a dropper how to do it?",
  "research.arcana.automated_alchemy.stage.2": "Prototype after prototype wasted. Something odd is afoot here. Even getting a machine to perform identical actions to myself does not cause the proper reactions. Almost like some {i}intent{r} is necessary.",
  "research.arcana.automated_alchemy.stage.3": "Now, a thinking machine. That would do it.",
  "research.arcana.automated_alchemy.stage.4": "Giving a Dropper a basic level of \"understanding\" is a perfectly safe and simple method of automating alchemy.\nThe Knowledgeable Dropper can be given a Tome of Sharing within it's extra tenth slot. Items it drops will be eligible for any alchemy recipes stored within the research bound to the book. When an alchemy recipe is performed automatically, the result will be thrown from the crucible in a random, free horizontal direction (or just randomly if none are free).\nAnother minor feature is that these droppers have slightly less variation in how they drop items.\nIt turns out that Tomes of Sharing do remember research entries, but simply choose not to show them to players. The thought of my equipment colluding to snoop on my mind is unsettling... but what can a book really do?",

  "research.arcana.alchemical_glass.stage.1": "Glass is a wonderful substance. Unreactive, transparent, commonly available... and extremely flimsy.\nCorrecting mistakes while should not require specialist equipment, and I wouldn't put too much trust in ordinary glass as a component in my devices.\nSome upgrades are in order.",
  "research.arcana.alchemical_glass.stage.2": "The first fruits of my work come in the form of Hardened Glass. Stronger - resisting explosions and less prone to accidents - yet more resilient - dropping itself in one piece when broken.\nI do have questions about what other properties I can give to glass this way... how about making it even more conductive to light and vis?",
  "research.arcana.alchemical_glass.stage.3": "As-is, glass isn't much more opaque than empty space. No, the interesting part is when you allow it to capture light and vis.\nLuminiferous Glass, while appearing transparent, has a huge amount of photons and lux captured within. On the outside, this manifests as a bright glow, on par with Glowstone. In the future, a material like this will be useful to use as a component in magical devices.\nNow, I wonder if it's possible to make glass conductive to not just energy, but matter. Would it simply fall through the crucible? Is it even a well-formed question?",
  "research.arcana.alchemical_glass.stage.4": "...apparently, yes, this is fully possible.\nStatic Glass is usually solid, but becomes like a gas in the presence of a crouching player - allowing their passage (or fall) - before reforming into a solid.\nThis has a couple of potential applications in home decor. Artifice? Perhaps, if I can trigger it mechanically.",
