  "research.arcana.aspects.desc": "The Building Blocks",
  "research.arcana.aspects.text": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them are key insights into the workings of reality.\nAll matter is composed of Aspects, the fundamental building blocks of reality. Aspects come in a number of varieties, about {c3}{$numOfAspects}{r}, each of which corresponds to some concept.\nAll aspects are composed of two simpler aspects, with the exception of the six Primal aspects: {aspect:air}{c6}aer{r} (air), {aspect:earth}{c2}terra{r} (earth), {aspect:water}{c1}aqua{r} (water), {aspect:fire}{c4}ignis{r} (fire), {aspect:order}{c7}ordo{r} (order), and {aspect:entropy}perditio (entropy).\nThe chemical elements are, unintuitively, also fundamental building blocks. Elements and aspects are two \"lenses\" with which to view and modify the world, and different things lend themselves to a different lens.\nThese aspects can also apparently be isolated into solid-like, fluid-like, and gaseous forms. Crystals are solid, and result from overflows of a particular aspect in the aura. The aura, in turn, is made up of the more gaseous vis form, and is almost entirely uniform, except around nodes, which produce a constant supply of primal vis.\nFinally, equipment can supposedly be used to purify it into a fluid state known as essentia. The notes were frustratingly vague on this... the equipment seems both too complex to infer from diagrams, yet so commmonplace that they neglected to explain properly. Their most powerful tools relied on it extensively, seemingly forcing me to reinvent their basic practices myself.",

While nothing arcane is without risks, a buildup of flux can pose serious risks to yourself and the world.\nTaint being one of them. Some sort of corruption, or parasite, or {i}something{i}, that works its way through the world, and twists living beings into horrific monsters when left to its own devices; feeding on the flux created by ambitious or negligent alchemists.\nAnd while I couldn't fully parse the notes on warp... the dark rituals and grim compulsions that surrounded it were certainly enough to provide a bad first impression.\nIf I don't study these risks, how am I supposed to protect myself from them? I should get a look of this \"flux\" myself. A small amount should be perfectly manageable.",
  "research.arcana.flux.stage.2": "...that was probably a mistake. Everything just {i}feels{i} off here. I would do well not to let it grow much higher, lest it start producing physical effects more serious than a headache and stomachache... ugh, I don't even want to know what warp feels like.",

The tools once used for this were wands, constructed from a wide variety of materials that combine to create powerful magic.\nConstructing a simple wand is as simple as capping off a stick with purpose-build metal wand caps, the same design reusable as I improve my materials and skills.\n{i}Some{r} notes seem to refer to the use of a special glove, directly grabbing the vis with my hands; constructing such a thing seems impossible with what I have available, however.",
  "research.arcana.wandcraft.stage.2": "Now, I have a real way to control magic. Soon, I'll be tapping on walls and whispering spells to open hidden gateways...\nBut first, I'll need to charge my wand with energy, by draining a node of it's power.",

These sources - or nodes, as I have come to know them - seem to be scattered across the world, constantly {i}creating{r} new energy. Something I believed to be impossible.{~sep}Nodes aren't quite uniform. Different nodes are attuned to different aspects, only producing those, and holding onto larger amounts of them.\nSome nodes are brighter than others, producing vis more rapidly and holding onto more.\nI can drain their vis into a wand by holding right-click. As long as I don't completely drain them, their aspects will simply replenish over time.\nFully emptying one can damage it, lowering it's aspect caps - or worse, paling it - so I should be careful.{~sep}A few of them seem to act... strangely. Sucking in terrain, corrupting nearby crystals, emitting a depressing aura... I would do well to study these properly.",

  "research.arcana.arcane_crafting.stage.2": "An Arcane Crafting Table is capable of everything it's ordinary variant is capable of, but can additionally craft magical items that require vis, supplied by my wand.\nOne such critical item is the Goggles of Revealing, which makes visible the vis around me.\nWhen the goggles are worn, nodes become brighter and visible through terrain, and I can see the aspects contained within them.\nOf course, further investigation into arcane devices is in order. I'll store this in the {c3}Artifice{r} tab of the Arcanum, accessible by selecting the goggles icon on the left.",

  "research.arcana.research.stage.1": "I can't go off the notes of long-dead magicians forever. I'll need a proper environment for my work; for testing theories, constructing theorems, and cross-referencing clues. I need a Research Table.",
  "research.arcana.research.stage.2": "Now I have a proper space to do my work.\nMany insights and items will require me to sit down at a research table and complete a {i}research puzzle{i}. The exact puzzle will depend on what I'm trying to learn about. By clicking on the puzzle requirement with paper and Scribing Tools on me, I can get a Research Note to place inside the table and start working on.{~sep}The basic puzzle, {i}Chemistry{i}, requires me to connect a set of aspects on a hexagonal grid.\nEach note starts with a somewhat-random amount of each primal aspect. I can combine two aspects (if there exists a compound of them) by placing them at the bottom of the sidebar, and pressing '+'. I can also place aspects on the grid by left clicking; both use up the amount on that note. Compound aspects connect to their components (and vice versa, components to their compounds).\nOnce all pre-placed aspects are connected, the puzzle is solved. If I make a mistake, I can right click on the grid to remove an aspect; it is not returned to the note, though, so if I'm too wasteful, I may need to restart with a new note.\nI should give this a go now.",
  "research.arcana.research.stage.3": "This puzzle isn't too hard, though I can picture more complex items requiring more effort, with more complex aspects.\nI should keep in mind that the {c3}Aspects of Magic{r} page displays all aspect combinations, in case I get stuck.",

  "research.arcana.node_channelling.stage.2": "Observing the way vis flows through different materials has allowed me to enhance the way I drain nodes.\nDraining a node will now always leave it with 1 vis in each aspect, preferring to drain another, unless all aspects only have 1 vis.

  "research.arcana.node_channelling_2.stage.2": "Now, I can pull vis from nodes even faster, approaching the speed at which vis diffuses in air. Additionally, draining a node completely of a single aspect no longer has a chance of paling it. Fully draining multiple, however, still might.\nI do wonder if I could increase the rate of recharge by submerging the node... or if I can alter it to become more powerful in some other way...\nThis will require further investigation.",

  "research.arcana.alchemy.stage.1": "Like the mundane elements, I will benefit by learning to separate and combine aspects, and the simplest method available to me to do so is plain old heat.\nOf course, magic must be used to catalyze this breakdown, and no mundane material could possibly handle the heat required - but a flick of my wand should upgrade a regular cauldron to do just that.",
  "research.arcana.alchemy.stage.2": "A Crucible can be used to melt down items into their constituent aspects. When filled with water and placed over a heat source (like fire, lava, or magma), anything thrown inside will be dissolved, and their aspects added to the water-essentia solution.\nActually purifying this essentia into a usable form is far beyond me, and will require dedicated equipment, but that's not to say it's useless in its current form; a variety of alchemical recipes can be performed with it.\nIf I throw a catalyst for an alchemy recipe I know into a crucible (and it contains all the required aspects), instead of being broken down, it'll absorb those aspects and be transformed into something new.\nOne basic application of this is Nitor: a stable and bright flame, created from coal and light.\nI can empty a crucible by sneak-right-clicking on it, releasing all of its currently stored aspects. If it has no aspects (only water), I can also empty it with a bucket.\nI should note that, since blocks and other entities know no alchemy, items they drop will {i}always{i} be broken down; also, that my Goggles of Revealing allow me to see the aspects stored inside.\nI believe some dedicated study of alchemy is in order.

Besides, a magical solution seems more fun to implement",
  "research.arcana.tome_of_sharing.stage.2": "Enchanting another copy of the Arcanum to copy knowledge from my mind in a highly readable format was surprisingly simple. Perhaps I should be worried about that.\nWhen a Tome of Sharing is used by any player when crouched, they will have their research progress added.

Even enchantment is a nuisance.\nThe notes often reference a material named {u}Thaumium{r}, created by alchemically imbuing a metal with magic itself.

  "research.arcana.purification.stage.2": "This is certainly one way of doing it.\nThe aspects added reinforce the metal's structure, with the extra metallum acting as a substitute for the impurities. This does mean that some metal is required as input, and some of the input is still wasted, but I could not find a better way around it.\nNow, to apply this to other metals.

When an alchemy recipe is performed automatically, the result will be thrown from the crucible in a random, free horizontal direction (or just randomly if none are free).\nAnother minor feature is that these droppers have slightly less variation in how they drop items.\nIt turns out that Tomes of Sharing do remember research entries, but simply choose not to show them to players.

No, the interesting part is when you allow it to capture light and vis.\nLuminiferous Glass, while appearing transparent, has a huge amount of photons and lux captured within. On the outside, this manifests as a bright glow, on par with Glowstone. In the future, a material like this will be useful to use as a component in magical devices.\nNow, I wonder if it's possible to make glass conductive to not just energy, but matter. Would it simply fall through the crucible? Is it even a well-formed question?",
