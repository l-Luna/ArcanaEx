  "research.arcana.root.text": "A sudden burst of inspiration, key insights that make clear the meaning of these scribbled notes... the way forward is unclear, but I know that this is the start of something magical.\nI'll write down my research in this book: the Arcanum, with all of the old notes stored inside for reference.",

  "research.arcana.aspects": "Aspects of Magic",
  "research.arcana.aspects.desc": "The Building Blocks",
  "research.arcana.aspects.text": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them are key insights into the workings of reality.\nAll matter is composed of Aspects, the fundamental building blocks of reality. Aspects come in a number of varieties, about {c3}{$numOfAspects}{r}, each of which corresponds to some concept.\nAll aspects are composed of two simpler aspects, with the exception of the six Primal aspects: {aspect:air}{c6}aer{r} (air), {aspect:earth}{c2}terra{r} (earth), {aspect:water}{c1}aqua{r} (water), {aspect:fire}{c4}ignis{r} (fire), {aspect:order}{c7}ordo{r} (order), and {aspect:entropy}perditio (entropy).\nThe chemical elements are, unintuitively, also fundamental building blocks. Elements and aspects are two \"lenses\" with which to view and modify the world, and different things lend themselves to a different lens.\nThese aspects can also apparently be isolated into solid-like, fluid-like, and gaseous forms. Crystals are solid, and result from overflows of a particular aspect in the aura. The aura, in turn, is made up of the more gaseous vis form, and is almost entirely uniform, except around nodes, which produce a constant supply of primal vis.\nFinally, equipment can supposedly be used to purify it into a fluid state known as essentia. The notes were frustratingly vague on this... the equipment seems both too complex to infer from diagrams, yet so commmonplace that they neglected to explain properly. Their most powerful tools relied on it extensively, seemingly forcing me to reinvent their basic practices myself.",

  "research.arcana.flux.stage.1": "My new perspective has enabled me to understand the ramblings of these scribbled notes.{~sep}Among them were various vague warnings of \"flux\", \"taint\", as consequences for mishandling magic.\nFlux is a kind of pollution of the aura, produced through wasteful alchemy, or inefficient equipment. While nothing arcane is without risks, a buildup of flux can pose serious risks to yourself and the world.\nTaint being one of them. Some sort of corruption, or parasite, or {i}something{i}, that works its way through the world, and twists living beings into horrific monsters when left to its own devices; feeding on the flux created by ambitious or negligent alchemists.\nAnd while I couldn't fully parse the notes on warp... the dark rituals and grim compulsions that surrounded it were certainly enough to provide a bad first impression.\nIf I don't study these risks, how am I supposed to protect myself from them? I should get a look of this \"flux\" myself. A small amount should be perfectly manageable.",
  "research.arcana.flux.stage.2": "...that was probably a mistake. Everything just {i}feels{i} off here. I would do well not to let it grow much higher, lest it start producing physical effects more serious than a headache and stomachache... ugh, I don't even want to know what warp feels like.",
